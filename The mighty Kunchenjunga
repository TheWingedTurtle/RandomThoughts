The mighty Kunchenjunga

So it was yet another shivering morning in Darjeling. Just a day before was Gangtok and now this city had nothing new to offer.
Crowded streets, littered conrners made it feel like any other Indian city.
Nevertheless we were here and had one day to stroll. So we went to view few spots here and there. But nothing new to eyes. Seemed like street food was the main
attraction. Like any other indian city. It was morning 9 when our cab driver took us to yet another boring park. Nehru park it was called. Nothing lavish,
Just a round garden, with few flowers, and an entry fees to stale things further. But we were here, so we went inside.
One corner of garden was facing the valley, where vendors with their telescope were standing ready to strike you deal any moment. 150 for 5 minutes they said.
Another corener saw hawkers selling flowers. and yet another some local antiques. It was around 10 when we were just fooling with one of the hawkers selling toys.
Suddenly she said to us, turn around Bhaiya! all of us were amazed by the view we saw! The might kunchenjunga. Standing like no other mountain nearby. Different from all the surrounding, One could easily tell, that is was something different, something magnificant. The very first sunlight fell upon its snow covered surface and it even more beautiful with its golden top.
One more striking feature which amazed me was that, the mountain beacuse of its size, miraged as if it is within my reach, just few steps and I would be on top of it. 
Eventhough the fact it that it is one of the most difficult mountain to conquer! Not isnt that the basic properity of greatness, even if we are talking about humans. Great
Humans always feel approachable, as if they were reachable, but on ones who have actually tried to reach at the summit know how tough it is to be of greatness.
